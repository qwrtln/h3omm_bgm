### To work on this locally:

    1. Clone this repository or hit that "Code" buitton and then download .zip
    2. Once cloned/unzipped, open index.html in any browser and it's now all running locally.

### Q/A:
#### 1. Wait, is it just index.html?

> Yep, index.html is the "root" of a website. a PWA is just a website that is cached locally to your desktop/mobile phone. Github pages let's me "host" this repo as a website with https, which is the only real requirement for a PWA. Any web server could host these files and make it a PWA if you set up https.

#### 2. What framework are you using?

> @pwabuilder/pwaupdate they make this dead simple, the sw.js + manifest.json do most of the work for the PWA side of things thanks to that team.

#### 3. Do you own any of these assets?

> HECK NO! These are ALL copyrighted works. Most is owned by Ubisoft, some are fan made (Cove), and some are from the board game (Archon).

#### 4. What's the license actually cover then?

> Just the source code of this repo.

#### 5. Can you add or change something?

> Yeah probably, make an [issue](https://github.com/ExeVirus/h3omm_bgm/issues), but you'll need a github account, sorry!

#### 6. Is there other cool stuff?

> Absolutely! I recommend starting with the [community rulebook](https://github.com/Heegu-sama/Homm3BG)
>
> And there's stats tracking/export and a timeline feature, built in!
